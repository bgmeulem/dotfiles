# dotfiles

This is simply a tracker of my dots. These are not necessarily meant for redistribution, I simply keep them here for version control and sharing with friends.

I don't claim any ownership for any of these themse or scripts. In fact most configuration is taken from ML4W (see: https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles). I figured it was easier to start with a working system and move laterally, rather than starting from scratch. In reality, a combination of the two has been educative.
