# dotfiles

This is simply a tracker of my dots. These are not necessarily meant for redistribution, I simply keep them here for version control and sharing with friends.

I don't claim any ownership for any of these themse or scripts. In fact, as of the time of writing (18/05/2025), most configuration is simply ML4W (see: https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file), with only minor tweaks, and a relatively vanilla kickstarter nvim config, again with minor tweaks.
